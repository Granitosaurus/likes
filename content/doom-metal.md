Summary: By far the heaviest sort of music you can produce. I find the gloomy sound so captivating and psychedelic.

I've been introduced to this genre by a reddit thread - about black blues musician who discovered this music and felt real connection. That's exactly what I felt the first time I heard Electric Wizard. The first song I've heard was probably the most famous modern song: Funeropolis

I've been somewhat interested in blues bot often I'd find it not pure or gloomy enough - doom metal scratches this itch really well!

Electric Wizard is my favorite doom band but there are just so many great choices in this not-so-little subgenre! Black Sabbath is the band started it all but the medium really started to become it's own thing in late 2000s and it's growing every day!
