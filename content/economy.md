Summary: I find economy's role in our society fascinating. Majority of our lives are influenced by economic designs and decisions and yet it's not that apparent.

My interest in economy was started by Bitcoin. The idea of decentralized programmable money was really captivating. This kinda led me into the world of liberal finance and later to economy at large.

The real interest started with economic book called "freakonomics". I was looking around a book shop for a graduation gift for my friend who just have graduated from business management major and I stumbled upon Freakonomics. Little did I know that it was one of the most popular recent books on economy! I got a an ebook copy on it myself and went through it. It really turned out an interesting subject and the book revealed how economy influences our lives.  
Turned out that there's a podcast too by the same author. I've been listening to Freakonomics ever since!
