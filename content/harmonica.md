Summary: Such a practical instrument! I really enjoy the bluesy sound it produces and I got introduced by it by Cowboy Bebop animated show that featured one of the best players in the world - Wheeping Harp!

I admit the sound sometimes can be overwhelming but when played accordingly it sounds super bluesy. I very much prefer it as a solo instrument or at least as a main one as it sounds quite overwhelming - in a good way!
