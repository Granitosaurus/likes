Summary: Origami is such a practical art expression - all you need is a piece of paper and you can make an object out of it: how cool is that?

I really enjoy Origami - thought I'm rather unskilled at it. It's a really practical art form as you only need a piece of paper. It's also really hard to get into as there are many books and youtube videos to guide you through!

The first attempt is almost always a garbled flop, but that's kinda part of the fun as you can see yourself progress!
