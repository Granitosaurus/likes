Summary: I love 80s Neon aesthetic and deep synthetic sounds. I already mentioned that I like Vaporwave and while similar outrun is a different take. While Vaporwave is often mellow and nostalgic, outrun feels opposite of the same coin: active and nostalgic.

Outrun appears in many different forms though mainly in visuals and music and I'm very fond of both! Visual are sharp, optimistic and bright which provides this energetic but slightly dark futuristic look. I've been listening to a lot of outrun music while working. It gives me a bit of boost though occasionally it might get away in focus. 

This has been my favorite spotify playlist so far:

At some point I'd really like to open neon-themed caf√© that would either be outrun or vaporwave inspired and I could never find anything like this.
