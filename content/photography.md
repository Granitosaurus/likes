Summary: Photography is a fun, accessible and pragmatic art medium. New phones come with brilliant cameras and it's so easy to always be ready for some cool shots - and there are so many!

I'm not sure what sort of photography I enjoy the most. I like abstract and nature photos though my nature shots tend to be quite average, abstract and artsy stuff feels more of my thing.

I've been thinking of starting a photography blog but I still have a lot to learn. Recently though I've been studying Darktable program a lot which definitely helped to improve my photography game!
