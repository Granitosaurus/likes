Summary: I used to heavily dislike Sauna but over time it kinda grew on me. Major enjoyment that I discovered is actually my new enjoyment in stressing my body - it weirdly feels rejuvenating!

I actually used to live in Estonia and even stayed in a house that had a sauna in it! That being said I always felt uncomfortable in one and the whole experience felt rather pointless.  
Now that I live in Thailand which is often pretty much a big sauna on it's own I discovered my enjoyment for this weird activity! 

My last condo had the nicest sauna I've ever been with city view and was just such a zen place to chill at. Sitting there for 20 minutes and then jumping into cold pool was such a refreshing experience.  
My current condo also has a nice sauna and a really really cold pool that makes such a great combo!
