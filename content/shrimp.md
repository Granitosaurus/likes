The first time I've got introduced to shrimp tank was in a small cosy cafe in Da Nang, Vietnam and ever since then I wanted to have one. The shrimp as just so adorable and the whole scenery is just so relaxing and calming!

At the end of 2019 I got a small tank here in thailand. It was only 70â‚¬ and the shrimp themselves are super cheap too. We got some Dario fish too but I feel that I'd prefer the tank without them. 

I often work at the kitchen with shrimp keeping me company - it's a very calming experience.

I leave you with a short timelapse I made:
