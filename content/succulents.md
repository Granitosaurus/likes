Summary: Succulents are super practical and just captivating plants. They feel alien, unique and captivating while only requiring minor care - by far my favorite plants to own!

I've always owned some sort of succulents, mostly cacti as they are most common. Recently when I moved to Thailand I got exposed to much higher variety of them as they are really cheap and plentiful here. My condo has a huge balcony too which can accommodate a whole jungle if I wish so!

The most interesting part about succulents is that they look like they're from a different world! They seem so unatural, quirky and almost defy what we think of what plants are!

I've always been meaning to dig into sciency bits of succulents but for the time being they are just lovely little friends that chill with me in the balcony.
