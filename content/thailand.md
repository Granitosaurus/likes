As of right now I've been 2 years in Thailand. It has been such a lovely place to live in as a remote worker. The rent is cheap, the food is delicious, the people are lovely and there's always something to do here!

There are few down-sides though. It's not as developed as europe and there's rampart corruption and the smog season (February to late April) really sucks but other than that it's hard to find things to complain about!
