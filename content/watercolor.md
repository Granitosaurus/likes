Summary: My favorite drawing/painting medium. Watercolor is so practical and it has this hazy psychedelic feeling as if you're drawing with clouds

I've only tried actual painting few times and really wanted to get into it to some extent but it just awfully impractical. As an alternative I've learned of watercolor and it ticks all of the right boxes! You only need thick paper, water and well - the watercolor.

I really fancy the style too - it quite psychedelic and flowing. I guess you could achieve similar goals with oil and acrylic paints but with watercolor it comes straight out of the box!
