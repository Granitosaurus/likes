Summary: A brilliant artist that is often considered to be the father for horror surrealism!

After world war 2 Poland, understandably so, started to produce some of the most interesting artists in whole wide world. Even though Beksinski didn't want his art to be interpreted you can definitely see lots of ww2 influences. This weird mix of ww2 horrors and modernity of new world brought us some of the first surreal horror paintings and they are absolutely captivating! 

There's something about these deserted, haunting landscapes that focus on central colossal subjects give off this haunting and addicting feeling that is difficult to describe. That's my favorite part of Beksisnkis work!

Here's an album of my favorite works by Beksinski:
