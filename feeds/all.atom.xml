Turns out it's such a varied drink that is part of an enjoyable preparation ritual.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's an acquired taste and it took me few years to get to it but since I've started my trip here in south-east asia I've got a taste for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started in Vietnam - the beautiful "phin" coffe caught my eye. The traditional coffe over there is prepared by pouring some condensed sweet milk at the bottom of the glass and putting a little filter device on top of it. The filter is being filled tight with grounded coffee beans and hot water is poured on top. It slowly drips on the milk and by the time it's done is has gently mixed with it as well as cooled down to drinkable temperature. The first sip you take is a bitter strong coffee maybe slight feel of the milk, then you mix the glass up a bit for a sweet milky relief.&lt;br&gt;
It's such a cosy procedure that really got me hooked on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vietnamese coffee my favorite as described above is my favorite but there's much more to the coffee world than that. I like flat whites and cappuccinos when going out, while at home I usually stick with french press with a splash of sweet soy milk. Sometimes pure black coffee with a dash of palm sugar is such an empowering breakfast drink.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="food"></category><category term="drinks"></category></entry><entry><title>Lofi Hip-Hop</title><link href="/lofi-hip-hop.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-02-16T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Bernard</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-02-16:/lofi-hip-hop.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lofi hip-hop has really been my core background music for a while now.

I used to think it's such a lame drink - might as well drink water but it turns out the tea medium is overwhelmingly huge. There are just so many different teas and herbal brews. Sure you can stick with good ol' green or black tea (the actual tea) but you can also explore blends. Blend some black tea with dried bergamot (basically lemon) and you've got Earl grey tea. What about orange? Berries? Some flowers? There are so many possibilities for blends!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are herbal teas which basically are all sorts of herbs that when boiled taste either nice or influence your body in some way. My favorite of such teas is simple chamomile tea which has pleasant, creamy mild taste and sweet odor of meadows. Throw in some cumin seeds and you've got yourself a bit of a kick too!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="food"></category><category term="drinks"></category></entry><entry><title>Economy</title><link href="/economy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-14T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-02-14T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Bernard</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-02-14:/economy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I find economy's role in our society fascinating. Majority of our lives are influenced by economic designs and decisions and yet it's not that apparent.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My interest in economy was started by Bitcoin. The idea of decentralized programmable money was really captivating. This kinda led me into the world of liberal finance and later to economy at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real interest started with economic book called "freakonomics". I was looking around a book shop for a graduation gift for my friend who just have graduated from business management major and I stumbled upon Freakonomics. Little did I know that it was one of the most popular recent books on economy! I got a an ebook copy on it myself and went through it. It really turned out an interesting subject and the book revealed how economy influences our lives.&lt;br&gt;
Turned out that there's a podcast too by the same author. I've been listening to Freakonomics ever since!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="hobbies"></category><category term="theory"></category><category term="concept"></category></entry><entry><title>Philosophy</title><link href="/philosophy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-02-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Bernard</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-02-13:/philosophy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Philosophy is one of my favorite subjects to study. In general I find thinking awfully addicting to the point and the questions raised in this subjects just feeds of this weakness of mine!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When growing up I haven't been exposed to the medium of philosophy at all. We got some theology (absolute rubbish) classes that we watched harry potter movies and alternatively you could pick ethics classes which I really felt connected to but it was hard to compete with movies and in my late teens I switched to that because of peer pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on I discovered a lot of philosophy through software, free/libre software to be more exact. The arguments made by libre community seemed so alien but at the same time so ratable and attractive - it made sense! Since then I've been a firm believer in this philosophy but not only that it opened up gates to a lot of other philosophical subjects from stoicism to weird niches like accelerationism!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll leave you with my favorite podscast series that introduced me to a lot of what philosophy has to offer, specifically great series on Friedrich Nietzsche made me a big fan of the false worlds concepts and how we live with them:&lt;/p&gt;

Recently when I moved to Thailand I got exposed to much higher variety of them as they are really cheap and plentiful here. My condo has a huge balcony too which can accommodate a whole jungle if I wish so!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part about succulents is that they look like they're from a different world! They seem so unatural, quirky and almost defy what we think of what plants are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always been meaning to dig into sciency bits of succulents but for the time being they are just lovely little friends that chill with me in the balcony.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="plant"></category><category term="nature"></category></entry><entry><title>Thailand</title><link href="/thailand.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-02-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Bernard</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-02-02:/thailand.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been living in Chiang Mai, Thailand for 2 years now - needless to say I love this place!

It has been such a lovely place to live in as a remote worker. The rent is cheap, the food is delicious, the people are lovely and there's always something to do here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are few down-sides though. It's not as developed as europe and there's rampart corruption and the smog season (February to late April) really sucks but other than that it's hard to find things to complain about!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="place"></category><category term="country"></category></entry><entry><title>Watercolor</title><link href="/watercolor.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-02-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Bernard</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-02-02:/watercolor.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My favorite drawing/painting medium.

&lt;p&gt;I really fancy the style too - it quite psychedelic and flowing.

&lt;p&gt;I've been somewhat interested in blues bot often I'd find it not pure or gloomy enough - doom metal scratches this itch really well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric Wizard is my favorite doom band but there are just so many great choices in this not-so-little subgenre!

&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2019 I got a small tank here in thailand. It was only 70€ and the shrimp themselves are super cheap too. We got some Dario fish too but I feel that I'd prefer the tank without them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often work at the kitchen with shrimp keeping me company - it's a very calming experience.&lt;/p&gt;

I've lived through the very inception of it and the 80s super-consumer atmosphere is right up my alley.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Vaporwave is a music genre but it's bigger than that. It was such an interesting pop culture art movement that I am happy to have gone through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up in the 90s and 90s Lithuania felt like 80s of the rest of the world. My first console was Sega Genesis at around 1997 to put things into perspective how behind we were. So the 80-90s capitalistic scene of vaporwave did resonate with me even though I never lived through the era american malls of the 80s. Once Lithuania picked itself up it kinda jumped through all of the fads in an accelerated time frame - shopping malls, neon colors, denim were all there but it flew by without many of us really getting to get into it. Maybe that's why I enjoy this feeling - it allows me go back a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course as music vaporwave was exactly what I like - it's was enjoyable, not taking itself too seriously but nevertheless making you think if you wanted to dig deeper. The sampling of various 80s beats, phrases and even movies or anime promoted this familiarity feeling of carelessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the A E S T H E T I C and meme community was absolutely top notch. I'm a fan of pastel colors and sunsets which really was the major part of vaporwave aesthetics. At some point I'd like to own a vaporwave themed cafe but by the time I get around to it the medium might be dead if it's not already :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll leave you with my favorite recent vaporwave piece and my favorite video essay on the subject:&lt;/p&gt;
