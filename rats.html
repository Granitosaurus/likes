        <p>Rats are absolutely adorable, smart and such fun creatures! I used to have 3 rats and were some of the best friends I've had!</p>
        <p>Rats were my first independent adult pets. I've had to lady rats and they were great pets with few big caveats. First I'll start with positives: they are super cute. They would explore, chill, eat and often act very human-like except. For me they were great pets as you can have one on your lap and do some work on your laptop or read a book - if you're a house person rats can really fit into your workflow!</p>
<p>The bad parts are that they love to chew cables and thing in general - it's a bit difficult to let them loose especially if you're having a bunch of tech lying around! <br>
Finally they don't live very long and are very attachable. Two of my rats died of cancer while the other died from some unknown nerve disease. They lived almost 3 years which is really good for rats but nevertheless you get really attach to them and the short lifespan is a huge turn-off. I probably don't want to have rats for this reason anymore.</p>
